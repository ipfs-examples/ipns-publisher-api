# ipns-publisher-api

An [IPNS](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/ipns/#mutability-in-ipfs) record publisher with a REST API to **manage** and **provide** (over pubsub and DHT) the records for decentralised resolution. The API also manages the keys.

In other words, a full [Helia IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs/helia) node with a custom REST API for managing and publishing IPNS names. You can run this if you want to publish multiple IPNS names and have an easy API to manage them. If deploying this publicly, consider adding an auth layer!

WIP.

Intended to show how to pick and choose [specific IPFS subsystem](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/how-ipfs-works/#subsystems-overview) for a given problem.
